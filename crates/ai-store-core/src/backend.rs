//! Backend SPI traits — implemented by storage adapters, consumed by the facade.
//!
//! `EventBackend` owns the append-only log and the mutable label index. It
//! deliberately exposes no delete/overwrite methods on events; immutability of
//! the log is guaranteed by the absence of those methods rather than by runtime
//! checks.
//!
//! `CacheBackend` is a materialization cache for state snapshots. It is a
//! derived artifact — pruning entries never violates the log's SoT property.
//!
//! `CheckpointBackend` persists `ProjectionSink` checkpoints so they survive
//! process restarts. It is optional — [`crate::Store::new`] runs without one
//! (checkpoints live only in process memory), and [`crate::Store::with_checkpoint_backend`]
//! attaches one.
//!
//! `SqliteBackend` is a separate, narrower SPI: a generic constructor
//! pattern for backends built from an existing native handle, so downstream
//! crates can write handle-agnostic backend factories.
